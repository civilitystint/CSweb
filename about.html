<h1> ABOUT <i> CIVILITY STINT </i> </h1>

<p>
    <big> <b> All J Pollock wanted when she was a child </b> was to quit taking piano lessons. A solo and independent artist
    from Orange County, California, the woman behind <b>Civility Stint</b> has loved music since she was a child,
    amateurly writing her own songs since she was 9 years old, strumming on the open strings of her sibling’s
    guitar. Baptized and raised in Catholic school*, she joined youth choir at age 10, and she participated in her
    parish’s choir intermittently until age 18. While in high school, she became a multi-instrumentalist, rekindling her
    love for piano as well as becoming proficient in guitar and bass. J was even part of reviving her school’s handbell
    ensemble. CS has spent the last decade of her life performing, and she hopes to make a career out of it.

    <br> J is also a music producer; she began by using Garageband on her sibling’s laptop to make short loops at the
    age of 13. Since 2021, she has been creating songs with Logic Pro, learning everything she knows about recording and
    music writing and production independently. She strives to have her presence and platform as an artist, creator, and
    activist open doors and create opportunities for those underserved and marginalized within music and beyond.

    <br> <br> <b> You are humbly invited to join CS as she makes moves toward pursuing her passion of music and artistry
        professionally. Thank you for listening. <3 - J </big> </b>

            <br> <br> <small> <i> *Although her backstory is heavily religiously involved, Civility Stint declares <b>
                        no religious
                        affiliation </b> and is not currently an active participant in any Church. </small> </i>
